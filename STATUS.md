Quantum Spin Master

# Project Status — Quantum Spin Master

## Current State
**Completed product**

Quantum Spin Master is a finished electromechanical device. The mechanical design, power system, and motion behavior have been implemented, tested, and validated on physical hardware.

---

## Product Maturity
- Mechanical enclosure: **Finalized**
- Power system: **Verified**
- Motor behavior: **Stable and repeatable**
- User control: **Complete**
- Assembly: **Consistent**

The device performs as intended without requiring software or digital control.

---

## Scope Confirmation

The scope of Quantum Spin Master is intentionally fixed.

The product:
- Spins at a constant speed
- Starts and stops via a physical toggle switch
- Operates independently without software

No digital control, programmability, or networking is part of this product.

---

## Known Constraints
- No speed variation
- No programmable behavior
- No electronic feedback or sensing

These constraints are intentional and aligned with the product’s purpose.

---

## Modular Extensions

Interchangeable attachments may be designed separately.

Attachments are considered **accessories** and do not change the core product definition or scope.

---

## Future Development

No further development is planned for the Quantum Spin Master core device.

Any future exploration will occur as:
- New attachment designs, or
- A separate product revision

---

## Availability

This repository exists as a **portfolio and product showcase** only.  
Internal design files and assembly details are private.
